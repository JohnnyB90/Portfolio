# Johnny's Professional Portfolio
 This was created for potential employers to have a one stop shop to find anything on myself.
 During this project, it really helped me further knowledge and cement things on using flexbox and displays.
 
## This portfolio contains a header with a profile photo and nav bar, an aboutme, a resume section with photos,
a section to view my prior work, and a bottom nav bar to contact me.

### This has no installation instructions and should only be used to find information on myself to help answer some questions about employee potential.
